dwm-flexipatch is an enhanced version of dwm that offers additional features
and customization options. While it retains the minimalistic design and
tiling/floating modes of dwm, it allows users to enable or disable patches at
compile-time, providing greater flexibility. Unlike the standard dwm, which
requires editing the config.h file for all changes, dwm-flexipatch supports
a modular approach, making it easier to tailor functionality to individual needs.
