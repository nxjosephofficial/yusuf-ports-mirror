py-soundcloud-v2 is a Python wrapper for SoundCloud's internal v2 API, allowing
developers to access read-only methods without requiring an API key.
This library facilitates interactions with SoundCloud data,
making it easier to integrate SoundCloud features into projects.
Note that it is not the official SoundCloud API, and the service
is currently not accepting new application registrations.
