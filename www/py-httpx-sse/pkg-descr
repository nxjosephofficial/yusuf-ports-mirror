httpx-sse provides an easy way to consume Server-Sent Event (SSE) messages using
HTTPX. It features synchronous and asynchronous helpers for connecting to SSE
endpoints, allowing for efficient event handling and reconnection strategies.
Ideal for real-time applications, it simplifies the
integration of SSE into Python web projects.
